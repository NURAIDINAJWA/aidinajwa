<b><li>SEKOLAH KEBANGSAAN LEREH</li></b>
<br>
<p align="left"> As a condition of my childhood in Melaka, I received my education in Melaka. When I was seven years old, my parents decided that I should attend Sekolah Kebangsaan Lereh, which is located in the same neighbourhood as my home. It was the best experience I had in primary school, and I have many wonderful memories of my time there, despite the fact that I was only there for a year because I had moved to Kedah.</p>

For your information, I am moving to Kedah since my parents have decided to move to Kedah for work reasons and also because they want to return to their hometown. From there, I begin to learn the slang of the Kedah people. It was a thrilling experience for me as a child. Not only that, I get new kedah friend and it was very make me happy.</p>

It is due to the fact that my mum is required to be transferred to another district for work reasons. As a result, I must enrol in a new school and meet new people, including new teachers and classmates, in a new environment. </p>

<b><li>UiTM MERBOK, SUNGAI PETANI, KEDAH</li></b>
<br>
<p align="left"> When I reach the age of eighteen, I will have the opportunity to continue my studies in Information Management at <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Mara">UiTM Kedah</abbr>. I've been here for two and a half years to study. It is such a wonderful experience to study here since I can improve myself in a variety of ways, including soft skills development and many other things. When I was there, I participated in a variety of programmes and met a diverse range of people. It is there that I learn about life as well as academics.</p>
