<p align="left"> Chicken Mill was the name of my business, which I managed as part of an assignment involving business activity. I chose the name "Chicken Mill" for my business since I offer chicken rice. The term Chicken Mill is derived from Chicken Meal, but I changed it to slang to differentiate it from the other businesses. Since my business offers just basic chicken rice and only one sort of chicken rice, it is known as Chicken Mill. As I was still in the try and error phase of the business, I chose to produce only one meal to prevent any losses. I chose to offer chicken rice because I possess the expertise to prepare tasty chicken rice and because my family encouraged me to do so and they confident that my chicken rice would be in high demand. Alhamdulillah, on the first day of the sale, my chicken rice was completely sold out with no waste. </p>
<br>
<p align="left">From my personal experience operating a Chicken Mill, I can attest that conversing with customers is really entertaining. At the same time, I can improve on my conversation skills and learn how to properly handle customers. Not only that, I get a sense of fulfilment when I make a sale and a wonderful feeling when customers give positive feedback about my chicken rice and services. Additionally, I earn a profit within three weeks of operating my business. I feel it was a positive experience for me and provided me with an incredible incentive to succeed as an entrepreneur in my life. </p>
