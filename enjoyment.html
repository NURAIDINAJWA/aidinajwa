<p align="left"> In my life, I like to do lot of activities; those activities help me exercise and made me feel alive, and my favorite activity is cooking because cooking is very simple. I started to cook when I was about 10 years old, when I was home alone all by myself and I was pretty hungry, I just got some bread, some cheese and put it in a microwave oven for 30 minutes and made me a grilled cheese sandwich. Since then I had been cook my own food when I was home or I have a lot of free time. </p>
<br>
<p align="left">Cooking is my favorite activity because it is a way for me to reduce stress and I can be artistic about it and it never gets repetitive. First, its a great way for me to reduce stress. Cooking and eating always help me to reduce stress, when every time I got all upset or stressed up I can just cook something I want and eat it, the deliciousness of the food I cooked had help me to reduce stress, but it was after started cook good. And I can do it regardless of the weather. </p>
